# StackArch

This project aims to provide a clear and educational example of a CPU design using a zero-address instruction format. The architecture emphasizes efficient use of a stack for executing operations, making it a valuable learning resource for computer architecture enthusiasts.

## Features

- Zero-address instruction format for concise and efficient code execution.
- Stack-based operation handling for seamless data manipulation.
- Educational resources and documentation for learning about stack-based architectures.
- Extensible design for experimentation and customization.

## Getting Started

To get started with StackArch, refer to the documentation for installation instructions and usage guidelines.
